Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. It is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Types of Machine Learning:

The 3 main types of ML are as follows.

<b><h3>1. Supervised Learning </h3></b>

Algorithms are trained using labeled examples; an input where the desired output is known. Here the machine is fed with a set of inputs along with corresponding correct outputs and the algorithm learns by comparing to find errors.

**Methods:** Classification, Regression, Prediction, and Gradient Boosting.

**Examples:**
- Image classification
- Identify Fraud Detection
- Weather Forecasting

<b><h3>2. Unsupervised Learning </h3></b>

It is used against data that has no historical labels. The system is not told the right answer. The algo must figure it out on its own. The goal here is to explore the data and find some structure within it. It works well on transactional data.

**Popular Techniques:** Self-organizing maps, Nearest Neighbor mapping, K-Means clustering, and singular value decomposition.

**Examples:**
- Segment text topics
- Recommend items and identify data outliers
- Customer persona investigation
- Pattern Recognition

<b><h3>3. Reinforcement Learning </h3></b>

The algorithm discovers which actions yield the greatest rewards through trial and error. It's about taking the best possible action or path to gain maximum rewards and minimum punishment. The agent learns to interact with the environment to achieve reward. The goal is to learn the best policy.

**Components:** The agent (learner/decision maker), the environment (everything the agent interacts with), and actions(what agents can do).

**Examples:**
- Robotics
- Gaming
- Navigation

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data (images or videos) in the same way that humans do. The concept of computer vision is based on teaching computers to process an image at a pixel level and understand it. Technically, machines attempt to retrieve visual information, handle it, and interpret results through special software algorithms.

Common tasks that computer vision systems can be used for include Object Detection, Object Classification, and Object Tracking.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge. Deep learning is an important element of data science, which includes statistics and predictive modeling. At its simplest, deep learning can be thought of as a way to automate predictive analytics. While traditional machine learning algorithms are linear, deep learning algorithms are stacked in a hierarchy of increasing complexity and abstraction.

## Applications of Computer Vision and Deep Learning:

- Medical Imaging (Detection of diabetic retinopathy, Cancer, Brain tumors, etc...)
- Facial Recognition (Biometric recognition)
- Content organization (Google/Apple Photos)
- Agriculture (Determine plant health and type)
