Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. It is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of Aritificial Intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Types of Machine Learning:

The 3 main types of ML are as follow.

<b><h3>1. Supervised Learning </h3></b>

Algorithms are trained using labeled examples; an input where the desired output is known. Here the machine is feeded with a set of inputs along with corresponding correct outputs and the algo learns by comparing to find errors.

**Methods:** Classification, Regresssion, Prediction and Gradient Boosting.

**Examples:**
- Image classification
- Identify Fraud Detection
- Weather Forecasting

<b><h3>2. Unsupervised Learning </h3></b>

It is used against data that has no historical labels. The system is not told the right answer. The algo must figure it out on it's own. The goal here is to explore the data and find some structure within. It works well on transactional data.

**Popular Techniques:** Self organizing maps, Nearest Neighbor maping, K-Means clustering and singular value decomposition.

**Examples:**
- Segment text topics
- Recommend items and identify data outliers
- Customer persona investigation
- Pattern Recognition

<b><h3>3. Reinforcement Learning </h3></b>

Algorithm discovers which actions yeild greatest rewards through trial and error. It's about taking the best possible action or path to gain maximum rewards and minimum punishment. Basically, the agent learns to interact with the environment to acheive reward. The goal is to learn the best policy.

**Components:** The agent (learner/decision maker), the environment (everything agent interacts with), actions(what agents can do).

**Examples:**
- Robotics
- Gaming
- Navigation
